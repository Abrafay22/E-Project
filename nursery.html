                Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>
                How I wonder what you are!<br>
                Up above the world so high,<br>
                Like a diamond in the sky.<br>

                When he nothing shines upon,<br>
                Then you show your little light,<br>
                Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.<br>
                Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>
                How I wonder what you are!<br>

                Then the traveller in the dark,<br>
                Thanks you for your tiny spark,<br>
                He could not see which way to go,<br>
                If you did not twinkle so.<br>
                Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>
                How I wonder what you are!<br>

                In the dark blue sky you keep,<br>
                And often through my curtains peep,<br>
                For you never shut your eye,<br>
                Till the sun is in the sky.<br>
                Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>
                How I wonder what you are!<br>

                As your bright and tiny spark,<br>
                Lights the traveller in the dark,<br>
                Though I know not what you are,<br>
                Twinkle, twinkle, little star.<br>
                Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>
